                            students, and policymakers, face challenges in staying
                            updated with the rapidly evolving advancements in the
                            technology and innovations in agricultural sector. The
                            agricultural sector is undergoing a transformation driven by
                            technologies such as precision farming, drones, AI, IoT, and
                            sustainable practices, but the dissemination of information
                            about these advancements is often fragmented, outdated, or
                            inaccessible to many.
                            Existing platforms often lack comprehensive, user-friendly,
                            and up-to-date content tailored specifically to the needs of
                            diverse stakeholders in the agricultural field. This gap in
                            information hinders the ability of users to adopt new
                            technologies, make informed decisions, and stay competitive
                            in an ever-changing agricultural landscape. </p>
